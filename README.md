## **Initial Plans :**

-   Visualization
    -   The info of the log file can be seen in charts formats
    -   The visualization of the stats need to be meaningful
-   Response on log files
    -   Can upload log files [initial]
    -   Can see the detection metrixs on that

2. Have the **home page** as the following
    - nav menu in the left
    - notification menu at the tight top

3. Have **adding files** option
4. Have the **datatable and pagination**
